# Gemini AI Clone with React

Welcome to the Gemini AI Clone – a modern web application that mimics Google Gemini’s chat interface using React.js. This project allows you to build and interact with a large language model (LLM) through a clean and responsive UI. Perfect for developers experimenting with LLM APIs or building AI-driven chatbots.



## Key Features

Chat Interface – Simulates conversation with an AI model through a user-friendly text interface.

Google Gemini API Integration – Plug in your own API key to enable real-time LLM responses (via Gemini 1.5 Flash).

Environment-Based Configuration – Secure API key handling using .env and VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY.

Responsive & Customizable UI – Built with clean components, conditional rendering, and optional light/dark themes.

Developer Friendly – Easily extend or customize components, styles, and model behavior.
